/**
 * Measure the retry judge on the labelled failures in `cases.ts`, beside
 * `patternRetryJudge`, the pattern list the server uses by default.
 *
 * Two errors, and they cost different things. A **wasted retry** — trying a
 * 404 again — costs one call that was always going to fail. A **missed
 * retry** — handing a 503 to the model — costs what the judge was meant to
 * save: a turn, in which the model usually retries it itself. Neither is
 * dangerous, because only calls that change nothing are ever retried; this
 * measures whether the judge saves anything, not whether it is safe.
 *
 * Run: npm run eval:retry
