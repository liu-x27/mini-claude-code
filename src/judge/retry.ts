 * Measured on `eval/retry` with llama3.1:8b, four wordings: "Is this error
 * temporary, so that the exact same call could succeed if it were simply
 * tried again?" missed 11 of 17 transient errors — it called every socket
 * reset and timeout permanent — and wasted none; this one misses 1 and
 * wastes 6 of 19. That is the right way round for this decision: a wasted
 * retry costs one call that fails again, a missed one costs the turn the

 * the same thing in every message they appear in, so there is nothing for a
 * model to read that a pattern cannot — and it is written by the same hand,
 * in the same hour, as the cases it is scored on, so read 36/36 as an upper

 *
 * The third use of the decision layer, and the smallest. A timeout or a 503
 * on a read is usually gone a second later, and retrying it costs one call;
 * handing it to the model costs a turn, in which the model mostly decides to
 * retry. A missing file or a 404 is not going to change, and retrying it only
 * wastes the call. That is a judgement about an error message, which is the
 * shape this layer is for.
 *
 * Three limits, set by the agent rather than here:
 *
 * - **Only calls that change nothing.** A `dangerous` tool — Bash, Write,
 *   Edit — is never retried: whether running a command twice is safe is not
 *   something an error message can tell you.
 * - **Once.** A second failure goes to the model as it is.
 * - **Every failure of the judge means no retry.** The model then sees the
 *   error exactly as it would without a judge, so a broken judge costs the
 *   saving and nothing else — fail-closed, pointed at "change nothing".
