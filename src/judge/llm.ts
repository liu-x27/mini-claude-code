/**
 * Judge by asking a small model for one token and reading the logprobs.
 *
 * The point of the single token is that the number comes from the model's own
 * distribution rather than from the model's opinion about its own confidence.
 * Asked to emit JSON like `{"confident": 0.9}`, a model writes whichever
 * number reads well; asked for one token, the ratio between P("Y") and P("N")
 * is a quantity it did not choose.
 *
 * This is the OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions path rather than the
 * Anthropic path, for one reason: the Anthropic Messages API does not return
 * logprobs. The rest of the framework talks to Anthropic and any
 * Anthropic-compatible endpoint; this one file needs a provider that exposes
 * token probabilities, and so takes its own base URL and key.
