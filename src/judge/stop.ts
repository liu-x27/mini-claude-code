/**
 * Deciding that a run should stop before the model says it is done.
 *
 * The loop already stops when the model ends its turn, and at `maxTurns`.
 * What is left to catch is the run that will reach `maxTurns` without getting
 * anywhere — the same failing call made again and again, or the same failing
 * approach in a slightly different form each time — because every turn of it
 * is paid for.
 *
 * The two errors are not equal. A missed stop costs turns until `maxTurns`,
 * which is bounded. A wrong stop interrupts a run that was working, and the
 * user has to notice and start it again. So both judges here are built to
 * stop late: they need several calls of evidence, and every failure of the
 * judge itself means "keep going".
