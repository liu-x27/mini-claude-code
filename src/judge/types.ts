/**
 * A fast decision layer for the agent's own control flow.
 *
 * The idea is not ours: a "System One" model answers declared, typed questions
 * about some state and returns probabilities instead of prose, so the control
 * flow can branch on a number rather than on parsed English. Routing, risk
 * gating, retry and stop decisions all have that shape — none of them need a
 * paragraph of generated text.
 *
 * Two primitives so far. Yes/no (`noul`) is what the risk gate and the router
 * need, and every backend can answer it. Pick-one-of-n (`choice`) arrived with
 * the first decision that had more than two outcomes — the snake arena's four
 * moves — and is a separate interface rather than a method on `JudgeBackend`:
 * a hand-written allow-list has no opinion on which way a snake should turn,
 * and a type that pretended otherwise would move that failure from compile
 * time to runtime. Place-on-a-rubric (`rubric`) followed the same way.
 */

/**
 * The facts a question is asked about.
 *
 * Deliberately a flat map of short strings rather than free text or the raw
 * tool input: a prompted backend renders it as `key: value` lines, and a
 * pattern backend reads the fields it understands. Neither has to parse the
 * other's format.
 *
 * Keep it tight. Decision models of this kind are documented to lose accuracy
 * when the state is padded with irrelevant context, so the caller's job is to
 * hand over the few fields the question is actually about.
