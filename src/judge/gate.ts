/**
 * The questions the gate asks, one per kind of harm.
 *
 * It started as a single question that listed all four harms in one sentence,
 * which cost 9 false allows out of 34 on `eval/risk-gate` — and four of those
 * nine were credential reads, the last clause in the sentence. Asking a model
 * for one yes/no over a disjunction makes it weigh the clauses against each
 * other; asking four narrow questions and taking the worst answer does not.
 * See the README for the measured before and after.
 *
 * Each one is phrased so that "yes" is the dangerous answer, and scoped to
 * damage rather than to taste: writing a file inside the working directory is
 * not on the list, force-pushing over someone else's branch is.

    // `git push --force`, `history -c`, `dropdb`, `docker system prune` — are
